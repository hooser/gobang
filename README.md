    Gobang is a logic strategy board game commonly played with black and white pieces and 19*19 
  board with intersetions from game Go. The origin of the game has been debated but researchers
  have found evidence indicating China has been the original country.
    The idea of this game is to provide a intelligent and completing Gobang program. In fact,this
  gobang is based on machine-learing algorithm.When the program starts it will start the renju_opening
  part. The program will choose the first few steps with it quicker. When the step number is above the 
  max number of renju_opening, the program will call on the evalution part. This part will first does a
  threat-space search. By which the program will warn the killing space you or your enermy will do. If 
  there is none of this, the program will evaluate the situation using alpha-belta pruning and score the 
  possible step you will take. It will return the highest-scoring step. In fact, the program is so intell-
  igent that I have never feated it even once. Good luck to you!
